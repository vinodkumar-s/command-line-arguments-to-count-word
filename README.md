## ALGORITHM: 
### Step 1: 
Import the sys module

### Step 2: 
Pass the filename as the first argument after the name of script. Open the file as sys.argv[1]
 
### Step 3: 
Read the file using read() method.

### Step 4:  
Use split() method to split the file content into words.

### Step 5:  
Use len() to find the total words.

### Step 6:
